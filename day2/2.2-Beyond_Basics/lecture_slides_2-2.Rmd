# Factors

# Factors

Common tasks:

* Turn a `character` or `numeric` into a factor

* Make a factor by "binning" a numeric variable

* Rename or reorder the `levels` of a factor


The packages `forcats`  ("for categoricals") gives nice shortcuts for manipulating categorical variables.


(`forcats` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---
# Turn to factor

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "dog", "banana", "cat", "banana", "Queen Elizabeth", "dog")

x

x <- factor(x)

x

```


---
# Recoding

```{r}
x <- fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana", pet = "dog", pet ="cat")

x
```

---
# `case_when()`

A catchall shortcut for making categorical variables is `case_when`.

```{r}
iris %>%
  mutate(
    Flower.Size = case_when(
      Sepal.Length < 5 ~ "Small",
      Sepal.Length > 6 ~ "Large",
      TRUE ~ "Medium"
    )
  ) %>%
    select(Sepal.Length, Flower.Size)
```

---
# Try the following.  What did it do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean <- read_csv("data/colleges_clean.csv")

colleges_clean <- 
  colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(CONTROL),
    Type = fct_recode(CONTROL, Public = "1", Private = "2")
  )
  

```

# YOUR TURN

## Adjust the `REGION` variable to be nicer.

(Consider: do you want to group regions further?)

# Strings

# Strings

A **string** is a bunch of **characters**.

Don't confuse a **string** (many characters, one object) with a **character vector** (vector of strings)


```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Kelly!"

my_vector <- c("Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Kelly")

my_string

my_vector
```

---
# Strings

Common tasks:

* Find which strings contain a particular pattern

* Remove or replace a pattern

* Edit a string (for example, make it lowercase)


The packages `stringr` is very useful for strings!

(`stringr` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---

# Find patterns

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hi there", "my name is", "Kelly Bodwin")

str_detect(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_locate(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_extract(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_subset(my_vector, "Kelly")
```

---

# Replace/Remove patterns


```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hi there", "my name is", "Kelly Bodwin")

str_remove(my_vector, "Kelly")
str_replace(my_vector, "Kelly", replacement = "George")
```

---

# Make edits

```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Kelly!"

str_to_lower(my_string)
str_to_upper(my_string)
```

---
# Your Turn

Using your `colleges_clean` dataset... 

* How exactly does Cal Poly's name appear in this dataset?

* **(hard!)** How many colleges have the word "University" in their name?

* **(harder!)** What is Harvard's out of state tuition?


Hint:  Remember that the `str_*` functions need the first argument to be a **vector of strings**, not a **dataset**.

---
# Solutions

How exactly does Cal Poly's name appear in this dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
colleges_clean <- read_csv("/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/rworkshop/data/colleges_clean.csv")
```


```{r}
colleges_clean$INSTNM %>%
  str_subset("Polytechnic")
```

---
# Solutions

How many colleges have the word "University" in their name?

```{r}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_univ = str_detect(INSTNM, "University")
  ) %>%
  count(is_univ)
```

---

# Solutions

What is the out of state tuition at Harvard?


```{r}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_harv = str_detect(INSTNM, "Harvard")
  ) %>%
  filter(is_harv) %>%
  select(TUITIONFEE_OUT)
```

# Dates

---

# Dates

Common tasks:

* Convert a date-like variable ("April 2, 1989") to a special DateTime Object.

* Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a DateTime object

* Convert between timezones


The package `lubridate` is **AMAZING** for this. 

If you work with dates often, please explore the functions - we are happy to help you after the workshop!


(`lubridate` does **NOT** load with the `tidyverse`)

---

# Choose a question or two to try to answer:

1. Are "better" schools more expensive?

2. Which states tend to have the "best deals" of colleges?

3. Do different regions have different public and private school distributions?

4. How does the size of the school relate to the cost, correcting for public versus private status?
