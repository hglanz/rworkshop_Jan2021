# Workflow

Your **workflow** is a set of good habits you get into to organize your work.

---

# What I do when starting a new **project**

1. Create a well-named folder; e.g. "STAT_218"
    + (I put these all on Dropbox.)
    + (I also make it a GitHub repository.)
    
2. Open **RStudio** <img src="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/R-icon-1024x576.png" width = 100>  NOT  <img src="https://fiverr-res.cloudinary.com/images/t_main1,q_auto,f_auto/gigs/110040952/original/b170c6473ca84360397ff561d81d9fbbee14d898/do-any-r-programming-and-data-analytics.png" width=100>


3. Create an **R Project** in the folder.
    + File > New Project > Existing Directory > (Find my "STAT_218" folder.)

---
# R Projects

Recall:  

* An R Project is simply a "flag" or "beacon" planted in a particular folder.

* It tells R which folder to treat as "home base"

* You don't need a full path to files; only a path relative to the folder where the project lives.

* "Project" is an apt name - you need one per project, not one per analysis.  (e.g.  "STAT_218" not "STAT_218_Final_Exam")

* Check your current project in the top right corner of RStudio.

# What I do when starting a new **analysis**

1. Open the appropriate R Project, by double clicking the blue cube. (**.Rproj**)

2. Create a new R Markdown File.
    + File > New File > R Markdown > (default options)
    + Save As > (Give it a good name) > (Put it in a reasonable subfolder.)
    
3. Save the dataset to my `/data/` subfolder.
    + Only if I want it on my home computer.

# My first three code chunks:

Setup:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Packages:

```{r, results = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Data:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
colleges <- read_csv("./data/colleges.csv")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
colleges <- read_csv("/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/rworkshop/data/colleges.csv")
```



(Reminder: Name your code chunks, think about chunk options!)

# YOUR TURN

---
class: center, middle

## Get yourself all set up to do an analysis of the `colleges` data.

(You do NOT need to create a new project, if you made one yesterday for your workshop activities.)
---
class: center, middle

# Step One: Understand the data

---
# Answer the following:

Documentation: [https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)

1. Who collected this data?

2. What information is in this dataset?

3. Is there much missing data?

---

class: center, middle

# Step Two: Adjust and clean the data

---

# Reminder: The Pipe

* Analysis steps flow sequentially.

* Code should read a bit like an English sentence.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  filter(hp > 100) %>%
  arrange(mpg)
```

---

# Piping tips

Recall: the pipe does nothing more than populate the first **argument** of a **function**

```{r}
bob <- 1:10

mean(sqrt(bob))

bob %>% sqrt() %>% mean()
```


---

# Piping tips

Think carefully about **object types**.

What does the function **expect as input**?

What does the function **give as output**?

--

Why doesn't the following work?

```{r, error = TRUE}
iris %>%
  summary() %>%
  select(Species)
```

---
# The five main verbs


* We `select` variables we want to keep in the data.
* We `filter` to rows we want to keep in the data.
* We `mutate` the dataset to add new variables
* We `summarize` the dataset to get information.
* We `arrange` the dataset to sort it.

# YOUR TURN

---

1. Narrow your dataset down to only:
    + Name of the institution
    + City, State, and ZIP code of the institution
    + The Admissions Rate
    + The average SAT score
    + The number of undergraduate students
    + The in and out of state tuitions
    + Whether the school is public or private
    + The "REGION" variable.
    
2. Check your variable types, and adjust them if needed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Hint:
iris %>%
  mutate(
    Sepal.Length = as.numeric(Sepal.Length)
  )
```

3. Create a new variable called `TUITION_DIFF` which contains the difference between in and out of state costs.

4. Remove all Private, For-Profit colleges (category "3")

5. Use `na_omit` do drop any rows with missing data.
    + Hint:  You may need to check out `?na_omit` to see how this works!

# Solutions

```{r}

colleges_new <- colleges %>%
  select(INSTNM, CITY, STABBR, ZIP, CONTROL, ADM_RATE, SAT_AVG, TUITIONFEE_IN, TUITIONFEE_OUT, UGDS, REGION) %>%
  filter(CONTROL != 3) %>%
  mutate(
    TUITIONFEE_IN = as.numeric(TUITIONFEE_IN),
    TUITIONFEE_OUT = as.numeric(TUITIONFEE_OUT),
    SAT_AVG = as.numeric(SAT_AVG),
    ADM_RATE = as.numeric(ADM_RATE),
    CONTROL = as.factor(CONTROL),
    TUITION_DIFF = TUITIONFEE_OUT - TUITIONFEE_IN,
    REGION = as.factor(REGION)
    ) %>%
    na.omit()
  
```

---
# Explore your new Dataset

* Check that everything did what you hoped.

* Briefly summarize the variables.


---

# Save your work:

The function `write_csv()` has two required arguments: 
* The name of a data frame object.
* A path and filename.

--

1. Use `write_csv()` to save your cleaned data as `colleges_clean` in your `/data/` folder.

2. Save your current R Markdown file as `colleges_cleaning.Rmd`.

3. Create a new R Markdown file called `colleges_analysis.Rmd`.  Do the initial setup chunks.

# Exploring and Visualizing the Data

---
# Answer the following

1. How many private and public schools are there in your data?

2. What is the overall average SAT Score?

3. What is the average SAT score for Private and Public schools?

4. Which school has the largest difference betweeen In- and Out-of-State tuition?

---
# Try to recreate this plot:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
colleges_new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = REGION, y = ADM_RATE, fill = CONTROL)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---
# Choose a question or two to try to answer:

1. Are "better" schools more expensive?

2. Which states tend to have the "best deals" of colleges?

3. Do different regions have different public and private school distributions?

4. How does the size of the school relate to the cost, correcting for public versus private status?
