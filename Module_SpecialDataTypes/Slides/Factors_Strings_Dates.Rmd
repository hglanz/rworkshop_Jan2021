# Setup

Create a new R Markdown file, and load in the dataset `colleges_clean.csv`, which is posted on the course site.

(This is a pre-cleaned version of the dataset from PA 2, "Find the mystery college".)

# Factors

# Factors

Common tasks:

* Turn a `character` or `numeric` into a factor

* Make a factor by "binning" a numeric variable

* Rename or reorder the `levels` of a factor


The packages `forcats`  ("for categoricals") gives nice shortcuts for manipulating categorical variables.


(`forcats` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---
# Turn to factor

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "dog", "banana", "cat", "banana", "Queen Elizabeth", "dog")

x

x <- factor(x)

x

```


---
# Recoding

```{r}
x <- fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana", pet = "dog", pet ="cat")

x
```

---
# `case_when()`

A catchall shortcut for making categorical variables is `case_when`.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    body_mass = case_when(
      body_mass_g < 4050 ~ "Small",
      body_mass_g > 4050 & body_mass_g < 5000 ~ "Medium",
      TRUE ~ "Chonker"
    )
  ) %>%
    select(body_mass, body_mass_g)
```

---
# Try the following.  What did it do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

colleges_clean <- 
  colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(CONTROL),
    Type = fct_recode(CONTROL, Public = "1", Private = "2")
  )
  

```

---
# Try the following.  What did it do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

colleges_clean <- 
  colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(CONTROL),
    Type = fct_recode(CONTROL, Public = "1", Private = "2")
  )
  

```

---
# Forcats

We will not practice every single function in the `forcats` package.

Find the `forcats` "cheatsheet" at https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-developed/factors

Use it to answer the following:

* What is the difference between `fct_relevel()` and `fct_recode()`?

* What is the difference between `fct_collapse()` and `fct_lump()`?

* What is the difference between `fct_reorder()` and `fct_inorder()`?

*Hint: Make up a couple of factors, and see what happens when you use these functions on them.*

# Strings

# Strings

A **string** is a bunch of **characters**.

Don't confuse a **string** (many characters, one object) with a **character vector** (vector of strings)


```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Bond!"

my_vector <- c("Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Bond")

my_string

my_vector
```

---
# Strings

Common tasks:

* Find which strings contain a particular pattern

* Remove or replace a pattern

* Edit a string (for example, make it lowercase)


The packages `stringr` is very useful for strings!

(`stringr` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---

# Find patterns

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")

str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")

```

# Exercise: What's the difference?

For each of these functions, give:

a) The **object structure** of the output.

b) The **data type** of the output.

c) A brief explanation of what they do.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")
```

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **logical vector** indicating if the pattern was found in that element of the original vector.

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **character matrix** with either `NA` or the pattern, depending on if the pattern was found.

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")

--

Returns a **data frame** with two **numeric variables** giving either `NA` or the start and end position of the pattern.

str_remove(my_vector, "Bond")
str_replace(my_vector, "Bond", replacement = "Franco")

# Stringr

Of course, we will not practice every single function in the `stringr` package.

Refer to the `stringr` cheatsheet:  https://stringr.tidyverse.org/

* What is the difference between `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()`?

* What is the difference between `str_trim()` and `str_trunc()`?

* What is the difference between `str_sub()` and `str_subset()`?

* What does the `collapse` argument do in `str_c()`?

# Your Turn

Using your *colleges_clean* dataset, answer these questions:

* How exactly does Cal Poly's name appear in this dataset?

* How many colleges have the word "University" in their name?

* Which college has the *longest* name?  The *shortest* name?

---

# Hints

*Hint 1:* The code below will be quite correct.  Why?
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_count(colleges_clean$INSTNM, "University")
```

*Hint 2:*  Remember that the `str_*` functions need the first argument to be a **vector of strings**, not a **dataset**.  You might want to use them *inside* functions like `filter` or `mutate`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_CA = str_detect(INSTNM, "California")
  )
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean$INSTNM %>%
  str_subset("Polytechnic")
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_univ = str_detect(INSTNM, "University")
  ) %>%
  count(is_univ)
```



```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_harv = str_detect(INSTNM, "Harvard")
  ) %>%
  filter(is_harv) %>%
  select(TUITIONFEE_OUT)

# Dates

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQ6A-NdWwAAncW-.png" width=300>

---

# Dates

Common tasks:

* Convert a date-like variable ("April 2, 1989") to a special DateTime Object.

* Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a DateTime object

* Convert between timezones

--

The package `lubridate` is **AMAZING** for this. 

(`lubridate` does not **load** with the `tidyverse` but it does **install** with it.)

---
# *DateTime* objects.

There are actually data types (classes) in R are for dates and datetimes.

They are called **Date** (duh), **POSIXlt**, and **POSIXct** (what???).

--

Don't worry about those names.  Just know that a "Date" or "DateTime" is yet another data class.

--

In the "old days", to make a Date or Datetime object, you'd have to get the format *just right*.

```{r}
as.Date("1989-04-02") %>% str()
as_datetime("1989-04-02") %>% str()
```

---
# *DateTime* objects.

Now, you can use easier functions from `lubridate`:

```{r}
make_date(year = 1989, month = 04, day = 02)
mdy("April 2, 1989")
parse_datetime("4/2/1989", format = "mdy")
```

---
# Common mistake

What's wrong here?

```{r}
as_datetime(2020-07-04)
```

--

```{r}
my_date <- 2020-07-04
my_date
```

---
# lubridate

Reference the `lubridate` cheatsheet: https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_lubridate.pdf

Use it, and your own experiments, to answer the following:

*Hint:* Consider data types and object structures!

1. What is the difference between `year()` and `years()` and `dyears()`?

2. What time zone does R think dates are in, by default?

3. What is the difference between `%within%` and `%--%`?

4. What happens if you use the `parse_datetime()` function, but you do not provide a `day` argument?

# YOUR TURN

Answer the following using code (even if you know the answer already).

1. Save your birthday as a Datetime object in R.  

```{r, include = FALSE}
bday <- make_date(year = 1989, month = 04, day = 02)
```


2. What day of the week does/did your birthday fall on in 2020?

```{r, include = FALSE}
bday2 <- bday
year(bday2) <- 2020
bday2 %>% wday(label = TRUE)
```

3. On what day of the week should you plan your 100th birthday party?

```{r, include = FALSE}
(bday + years(100)) %>% wday(label = TRUE)
```

4. Find the date that is exactly 9 months before the day you were born.  If it falls on a holiday, think about the implications.

```{r, include = FALSE}
bday - months(9)
```
