# YOUR TURN

## This time, create your own **R Markdown** file from scratch!

* You can do this via File > New File > R Markdown

* Don't forget to load your libraries (e.g. `library(tidyverse)`)

* Read in the `colleges` dataset yourself.

* Feel free to copy-paste from previous ones.

# Factors

# Factors

Common tasks:

* Turn a `character` or `numeric` into a factor

* Make a factor by "binning" a numeric variable

* Rename or reorder the `levels` of a factor


The packages `forcats`  ("for categoricals") gives nice shortcuts for manipulating categorical variables.


(`forcats` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---
# Turn strings to factors

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "dog", "banana", "cat", "banana", "Queen Elizabeth", "dog")

x

x <- factor(x)

x

```


---
# Recoding

```{r}
x <- fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana", pet = "dog", pet ="cat")

x
```

---
# `case_when()`

A catchall shortcut for making categorical variables is `case_when`.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    body_mass = case_when(
      body_mass_g < 4050 ~ "Small",
      body_mass_g > 4050 & body_mass_g < 5000 ~ "Medium",
      TRUE ~ "Chonker"
    )
  ) %>%
    select(body_mass, body_mass_g)
```

---
# Try the following.  What did it do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

colleges <- 
  colleges %>%
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(CONTROL),
    Type = fct_recode(CONTROL, Public = "1", Private = "2")
  )
  

```

---
# Try the following.  What did it do?

```{r, eval = TRUE}

colleges <- 
  colleges %>%
  mutate(
    CONTROL = factor(CONTROL),
    Type = fct_recode(CONTROL, Public = "1", Private = "2")
  )
  
colleges %>% select(CONTROL, Type)
```

---
# Forcats

We will not practice every single function in the `forcats` package.

Find the `forcats` "cheatsheet" at https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-developed/factors,
or in your *cheatseets* folder.

In your groups, try to answer the following:

* What is the difference between `fct_relevel()` and `fct_recode()`?

* What is the difference between `fct_collapse()` and `fct_lump()`?

* What is the difference between `fct_reorder()` and `fct_inorder()`?

*Hint: Make up a couple of factors, and see what happens when you use these functions on them.*

# Why do we care?

Suppose we wanted to look at the tuitions of all states:

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TUITIONFEE_IN, y = STABBR)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---
# Why do we care?

Ew.  Maybe we can order by size?

```{r}
colleges %>%
  mutate(
    State = fct_reorder(STABBR, TUITIONFEE_IN)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TUITIONFEE_IN, y = State)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Strings

<img src="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width=300>

---

# Strings

A **string** is a bunch of **characters**.

Don't confuse a **string** (many characters, one object) with a **character vector** (vector of strings)


```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Bond!"

my_vector <- c("Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Bond")

my_string

my_vector
```

---
# Strings

Common tasks:

* Find which strings contain a particular pattern

* Remove or replace a pattern

* Edit a string (for example, make it lowercase)


The packages `stringr` is very useful for strings!

(`stringr` loads with the `tidyverse`)

---

# Find patterns

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")

str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")

```

# Exercise: What's the difference?

For each of these functions, try to figure out:

a) The **object structure** of the output.

b) The **data type** of the output.

c) A brief explanation of what they do.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")
```

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **logical vector** (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) indicating if the pattern was found in that element of the original vector.

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **character matrix** with either `NA` or the pattern, depending on if the pattern was found.

---

my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")

--

Returns a **data frame** with two **numeric variables** giving either `NA` or the start and end position of the pattern.

# Replace/Remove patterns


```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_remove(my_vector, "Bond")
str_replace(my_vector, "Bond", replacement = "Franco")
```

--

*Ask yourself:*  What is the output?

# Make edits

```{r}
my_string <- "Hello, my name is Bond, James Bond."

str_to_lower(my_string)
str_to_upper(my_string)
```

---
# Stringr

Of course, we will not practice every single function in the `stringr` package.

Refer to the `stringr` cheatsheet:  https://stringr.tidyverse.org/,
or in the *cheatsheets* folder.

Use it to answer the following:


* What is the difference between `length()` and `str_length()`?

* What is the difference between `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()`?

* What is the difference between `str_trim()` and `str_trunc()`?

* What is the difference between `str_sub()` and `str_subset()`?

* What does the `collapse` argument do in `str_c()`?

# Your Turn

Using your *colleges* dataset, answer these questions:

* How exactly does Cal Poly's name appear in this dataset?

* Which college has the *longest* name? 

* How many colleges have the word "University" in their name?


---

# Hints

*Hint 1:* The code below will not be quite correct.  Why?
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_count(colleges$INSTNM, "University")
```
---
# Hints

*Hint 2:*  The `str_*` functions need the first argument to be a **vector of strings**, not a **dataset**.  You might want to use them *inside* functions like `filter` or `mutate`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
colleges %>%
  mutate(
    is_CA = str_detect(INSTNM, "California")
  )
```

---
# Solutions


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges$INSTNM %>%
  str_subset("Polytechnic")
```

---
# Solutions


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges %>%
  filter(str_detect(INSTNM, "Polytechnic"))
```

---
# Solutions

```{r}
colleges %>%
  mutate(
    name_length = str_length(INSTNM)
  ) %>%
  top_n(1, name_length)
  
```

---
# Solutions

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges %>%
  mutate(
    is_univ = str_detect(INSTNM, "University")
  ) %>%
  count(is_univ)

# Your Turn!

# What's in a name?

*Claim:*

Many public universities contain the word "State" in their name, such as **California Polytechnic State University**.

*Research Question:*

Suppose we did not know which universities were private versus public.  Can you make an argument showing that colleges with "State" in the name have larger In-State vs Out-of-State tuition differences than those without?
