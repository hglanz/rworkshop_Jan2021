## Setup

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed R code chunks throughout the document. Let's set up some of our packages and read in our data

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in Colleges Data


```{r import_data}
colleges <- read_csv("../data/colleges_clean.csv")
```

## Histogram of In-state Tuition

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TUITIONFEE_IN)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Boxplot of In-state Tuition

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TUITIONFEE_IN)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Barplot of Public and Private Schools

Hint: public schools have a value of 1 for the variable CONTROL, and private schools have a value of 2.

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = CONTROL)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Side-by-Side Boxplots of In-state Tuition for Public and Private Schools

Hint: public schools have a value of 1 for the variable CONTROL, and private schools have a value of 2. You may also need to convert the CONTROL variable to a character variable with `as.character(CONTROL)` within your ggplot code.

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = TUITIONFEE_IN, fill = as.character(CONTROL))) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Multipanel Histogram of In-State Tuition for Public and Private Schools

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TUITIONFEE_IN)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap("CONTROL")
```
