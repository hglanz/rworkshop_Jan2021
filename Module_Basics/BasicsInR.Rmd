### Lots of different backgrounds here!

# Why are you here? Why R? Why now?

---

# Why should you learn R?

* R is free, R improves, R has existed for a long time
* The support system for R is actually very good!
  * Many free textbooks online
  * Tons of announcements and content on Twitter
  * [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for coding questions

# But why should YOU learn R?

* R and R Markdown will save you TONS of time. Long term thinking is key.

--

  * You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
  
--

  * Remembering what drop-down menu something is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
  
--

  * Remembering to copy-and-paste your updated plots/analysis into your word processor is a pain and error prone

# Good Coding Habits


* [Good coding style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) -- Use a consistent style!

--

* Use some form of Git

--

* Take advantage of R Markdown, R Shiny, and R projects where appropriate

# What this workshop is

* Some of...

* Plus a few others: rmarkdown, gganimate, leaflet

---

# Let's Get Started

* [Installing R](https://www.r-project.org/)

  * Follow the "Getting Started" directions to download and install R
  
--

* [Installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

  * Click on "RStudio Desktop" and follow the directions to download and install the **open source edition** of RStudio Desktop
  
---

# Collecting the workshop materials

* Open RStudio

* In the Console pane (bottom left or just left by default) type the following and hit Enter

.center[**install.packages("usethis")**]

* Now, in the same Console pane, type the following and hit Enter

.center[**usethis::use_course("hglanz/rworkshop_Jan2021")**]

* You should see a new RStudio session open and come to the front of your screen except now, in the very top right corner of RStudio, you should see that light blue icon next to **rworkshop**

---

# What did we just do?!

* You installed Base R

* You installed RStudio

* You installed your first package: `usethis`

* You obtained all of our workshop materials (to your Desktop) via some functionality of the `usethis` package

* You opened an R project file called *rworkshop* (more on this later)

* **NOTE**: the `usethis` package is not necessary for work in R/RStudio, but is a very convenient tool for organizing and disseminating materials.

---

# Working with R through RStudio

* R is the language

--

* RStudio is the IDE (integrated development environment) -- not required to work with R, but highly recommended

# Reading data

<img src="https://readr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width=300>

---

# Where is your data stored?

* On your computer?

* On a website?

* On "the cloud"? (Dropbox, Google Drive, ...)

# How is your data stored?

* An Excel spreadsheet?

* A Googlesheets spreadsheet?

* A text file?

* A JSON/SQL/WTF file?

---

# Easy mode: Reading csvs

A file of **comma-separated values (csv)** looks like this:

```
Name, Age, Favorite Color,
Susie, 5, Blue
Kelly, 30, Teal
Hunter, 32, Goldenrod
```


> Excel spreadsheets can easily be saved as *csv*'s!

---

# Reading csvs

Option 1:  Base R

```{r read, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
read.csv()
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate("read",
         eval = FALSE) %>%
    flair_rx('\\.(?=c)') %>%
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

Option 2: The `readr` package.  (Recommended!)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
  library(readr)
  read_csv(...)
',
eval = FALSE) %>% 
    flair("_") %>%
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```


---

# Step one: Install the `readr` package

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
  install.packages("readr")
',
eval = FALSE) %>% 
    flair('"') %>%
    flair("readr", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

> DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR R MARKDOWN FILE!!!

> Use the **console**. :)

---


## If the file is in your **R Project** folder:
(In a subfolder called "data")

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
  dat <- read_csv("/data/my_data.csv")
  ', 
  eval = FALSE) %>%
  flair("read_csv", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("my_data.csv")
```

The `here` package contains some very handy functions for obtaining paths and locations of files relative to a project's root folder!

## If the file is elsewhere on your computer:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
  dat <- read_csv("/Users/kbodwin/Dropbox/Data/my_data.csv")
  ',
  eval = FALSE)  %>%
  flair("read_csv", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("my_data.csv")
```

## If the file is on the web:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
  dat <- read_csv("www.kelly-bodwin.com/my_data.csv")
  ',
  eval = FALSE)  %>%
  flair("read_csv", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("my_data.csv")
```

# Prerequisite:  The Pipe  `%>%`

---

# The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('penguins %>% summary()', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("%>%") %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

is the same as

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('summary(penguins)', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```


* Originally part of the `magrittr` package

* Central to the philosophy and design of the *tidyverse*
---
# Idea 1: Analysis steps should flow sequentially.
# Idea 2: Code should read a bit like an English sentence.

What do you think the following will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(bill_length_mm > 40) %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

# Visualizing data

---

class: center, middle

# The big idea: "Grammar of graphics"
## A visualization is formed by mapping *variables* to *plot aesthetics*
## The **geometry** of the plot determines the display style

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

```

The **bill length** is mapped to the **x-axis**, the **bill depth** is mapped to the **y-axis**, and the **species** is mapped to the **color**.

---

# Using ggplot2

**Step One:** Specify the dataset

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('ggplot(data = penguins)', eval = FALSE) %>% flair("data = penguins")
```


**Step One:** Specify the aesthetic

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = species))', eval = FALSE) %>% flair_rx("aes(.*)")
```

**Step One:** Choose the type of plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = species))
    + geom_boxplot()', eval = FALSE) %>% flair_rx("boxplot")
```

# Quick Quiz

Without running the code, what seems wrong in each of these three code chunks?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm)
    + geom_point()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm))
    + geom_bar()
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(y = bill_depth_mm, x = bill_length_mm)
    + geom_point()
```

---
# The Main Geometries

`geom_histogram`: requires `x`

`geom_bar`: requires `x`

(`geom_col`: requires `x` and `y`)

`geom_boxplot`: requires `y` and `x` or `group`

`geom_point`: requires `x` and `y`

(`geom_line`: requires `x` and `y` and special data)

# Common "extra stuff"

* `fill` is the **filler color**

Q: What is the difference between the following?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) + 
  geom_histogram()',
eval = FALSE) %>% flair_rx("fill = [:alpha:]*")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue")',
eval = FALSE) %>% flair_rx('fill = "[:alpha:]*"')
```

---

A:  Options in the **aesthetic** related to **variables**.  Other options are "global".


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
decorate('
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) + 
  geom_histogram()') %>% flair_rx("fill = [:alpha:]*")
```

---

# Common "extra stuff"

* `fill` is the **filler color**

* `+ ggtitle("My title")` to add a title

* `+ xlab("axis label")` or `+ ylab("axis label")` to label axes

* `+ theme_*` for various visual options

* ... and SO many more `geom_*` plot types!

# Multipanel Plots with `facet_wrap()`

We can create multipanel figures with the `facet_wrap()` function

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap("species")') %>% flair_rx("facet_wrap(.*)")
```



---

# ggplots are objects 

You can name them and change them later

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
p <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm))

p + geom_histogram() + ggtitle("Histogram")
```

---

# Saving your plot

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("my_filename.png")
```

This will save whatever you most recently plotted!

class: center, middle

## In the provided R Markdown file (basics_activity.Rmd), do the following to practice what we've seen so far

With the colleges_clean dataset, create a

* histogram of in-state tuition

* boxplot of in-state tuition

* barplot of public and private schools

* side-by-side boxplot of in-state tuition for public and private schools

* multipanel histogram of in-state tuition for public and private schools

# Short History of R

* An open source implementation of the S programming language combined with a few other things

* Functionality has expanded in an almost explosive way over the last 10-15 years via **packages**

  * This has been both awesome and challenging: new functionality vs. no formal coordination of consistent syntax etc.

* The `ggplot2` package for visualization, created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, is one of the most popular R packages

  * This is now considered part of what's known as **The Tidyverse**
  
* **The Tidyverse** is a colletion of open source R packages introduced by Hadley Wickham and his team that "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures" of **tidy data**

  * `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats`
  
  * **tidy data**: rows correspond to observations/cases and columns to variables
