# R History lesson:
# What is the `tidyverse`?

---
# The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages that follow a (somewhat) consistent philosophy and structure.

The term `base R` is sometimes used as an alternative, to refer to only R's built-in packages.

A brief history:

--

**2008:** `plyr` and `ggplot` released as part of **Hadley Wickham**'s doctoral dissertation.

--

**2012:** The pipe (`%>%`) is created.  

*(While the pipe itself is not technically tidyverse, the tidyverse is built around its use.)*

--

**2014:** `dplyr` released; Wickham hired as Chief Scientist at **RStudio**

--

**Today:** A paid team of 20-ish developers maintains a huge number of packages.  (https://www.tidyverse.org/)

---
# The tidyverse

* One philosophy of the **tidyverse** is building **pipe-friendly** functions.

* Another philosophy is using **English verbs** as function names instead of symbols or abbreviations.

* Some consider this more accessible/readable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```


---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Fairly consistent behavior of functions

    + Predictable **input** and **output** types
    + *"opinionated"*
    + More on this later
    
--

* Semi-guaranteed maintenance of packages

(because RStudio pays developers!)

--

* More available and polished documentation and tutorials

--

* Welcoming community

---
# The tidyverse

**Cons:**

* Sometimes less flexible for complex tasks

--

* Generally slower, especially on big data

--

* Updates frequently -> sometimes this makes your old code unrunnable.

--

* Some people object to **RStudio**'s strong influence over an open-source community.

# Should you use the tidyverse???

--

Even the most die-hard tidyverse fanatics use base R and other packages quite frequently.

--

Above all, the best code approach is the one you enjoy the most and that gets the job done!

--

You are free to use whatever package(s) you want in this class!

--

However, most of my lessons and examples will be in the **tidyverse**.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images", "other", "ceci_pipe.jpeg"))

# Prerequisite: The Pipe

* Part of the `magrittr` package (installs with the tidyverse)

--

* Idea:  The **data** is the primary object, so it should come first in your code.

--

* Idea:  Code should read **like a sentence**

--

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images", "other", "diagram_sentence.jpg"))
```

# The Pipe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dr_bodwin %>%
  do_a_dance()
```
--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dr_bodwin %>%
  put_on("cool hat") %>%
  do_a_dance(type = "macarena")
```

---

```{r pipe, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Images", "silly_gifs", "pipe.png"))
```

---

# The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('penguins %>% summary()', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("%>%") %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

is the same as

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('summary(penguins)', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

---
# The Pipe

What do you think the following will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---
# The Pipe

What do you think the following will do?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---
# Today's Data: Cereal

* Download `Practice.Rmd` from the class website.

* Run the first two chunks to load up the `cereal` dataset.

* Get a feel for the data - what does it contain?


*(This is not graded or turned in - it is just for you to follow along with lecture.)*


---

# Summarizing

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summary()
  ') %>% flair("y(")
```

---
# Cleaning

Oh no!  There was one row of the dataset with missing values.

--

There is no magic answer for how to handle missing values; one solution is to simply drop them from the data.

*Consider - why might this sometimes be a bad idea?*

--

```{r}
penguins <- 
  penguins %>%
  drop_na()

penguins %>% summary()
  
```


---
# Summarizing specifics

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
  ') %>% 
  flair("ize(") %>% 
  flair("mean", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("body_mass_g", color = "cornflowerblue")
```

--

* What are the **required** arguments of `summarize`?  

* Are there any optional arguments?

---

# Many variables?  Many summary statistics?
## No problemo

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(c(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm),
            list(mean, median)))
  ') %>% 
  flair("across") %>%
  flair_rx("(mean)|(median)", color = "teal") %>%
  flair_rx("(body_mass_g)|(flipper_length_mm)", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  flair_rx("list", color = "darkred")
```

# Your Turn!

---
class: center, middle
# In `Practice.Rmd`, find the following:

* Mean, Median, and standard deviation of the sugar content of cereals

* Total calories if I ate one serving of every single cereal in the dataset.

---
# Making new variables

Verb: `mutate()`

The dataset gets *mutated* to include a new variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
  ) %>%
  summary()
  ') %>%
  flair("mutate") %>%
  flair("bill_size", color = "teal")
```

---

Cool, let's look at our new variable!

```{r, error = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
```

--

OH NO!

**What happened here?**

---

class: center, middle

# We calculated a new variable, but didn't save our changes.

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins <- penguins %>%
          mutate(
            bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
          )
          
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
') %>% 
  flair("penguins <- ")


```

---
# Ordering

Verb: `arrange()`

We **arrange** the dataset in order of a particular variable.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

## Related: `top_n`

```{r}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

---

# Quick check in!

Remember,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

is the same as

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(penguins, 3, body_mass_g)
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(x = penguins, n = 3, wt = body_mass_g)
```

---

# Selecting

Verb: `select()`

We **select** which variables we would like to remain in the dataset.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

# Filtering

Verb: `filter()`

We **filter** to the rows (observations) we would like to keep in the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins_new %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

# Plotting: The pipe is your friend

Want a histogram of body mass for just *Adelie* species penguins?  Pipe it through `filter()` first!

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```

# Your Turn!

---

## In `Practice.Rmd`, make a new dataset called `kellogg_calories`, with the following changes:

1. There is a new variable called `cal_per_cup` which shows the number of calories in each cup of cereal.

2. The dataset only includes this new variable, the name of the cereal, and the brand of the cereal.

3. The dataset only includes Kellogg brand cereals

4. The cereals in the dataset are ordered from most to least calories per cup.

**Try to do all these in one sequence of pipes!**

5. Then choose one of the four main plot types (histogram, barplot, boxplot, scatterplot), make an interesting visualization from your `kellog_calories` dataset.

# Grouping and summarizing
---
# `group_by`

* We have learned how to use the `summarize` functions to get information.

* What if you want to summarize your data within categories?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean(body_mass_g))

```
---
# Warning!

## You should **always** have a `summarize` after a `group_by`!!!

(There are other ways to use it, but wait until you are very familiar with `dplyr` to try that.)

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Your Turn!

---
# Grouping and summarizing

* Find the average calories per serving for each manufacturer.

* Find the average sugar per serving for hot versus cold cereals.
