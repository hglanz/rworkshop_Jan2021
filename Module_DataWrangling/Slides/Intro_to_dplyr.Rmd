# R History lesson:
# What is the `tidyverse`?

---
# The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages that follow a (somewhat) consistent philosophy and structure.

The term `base R` is sometimes used as an alternative, to refer to only R's built-in packages.

A brief history:

--

**2008:** `plyr` and `ggplot` released as part of **Hadley Wickham**'s doctoral dissertation.

--

**2012:** The pipe (`%>%`) is created.  

*(While the pipe itself is not technically tidyverse, the tidyverse is built around its use.)*

--

**2014:** `dplyr` released; Wickham hired as Chief Scientist at **RStudio**

--

**Today:** A paid team of 20-ish developers maintains a huge number of packages.  (https://www.tidyverse.org/)

---
# The tidyverse

* One philosophy of the **tidyverse** is building **pipe-friendly** functions.

* Another philosophy is using **English verbs** as function names instead of symbols or abbreviations.

* Some consider this more accessible/readable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```


---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Fairly consistent behavior of functions

    + Predictable **input** and **output** types
    + *"opinionated"*
    
--

* Semi-guaranteed maintenance of packages

(because RStudio pays developers!)

--

* More available and polished documentation and tutorials

--

* Welcoming community

---
# The tidyverse

**Cons:**

* Sometimes less flexible for complex tasks

--

* Generally slower, especially on big data

--

* Updates frequently -> sometimes this makes your old code unrunnable.

--

* Some people object to **RStudio**'s strong influence over an open-source community.

# Should you use the tidyverse???

--

Even the most die-hard tidyverse fanatics use base R and other packages quite frequently.

--

Above all, the best code approach is the one you enjoy the most and that gets the job done!

# Motivation

Suppose we wanted to study college tuition in the large states of New York, California, and Texas only.  Let's make boxplots.

--

```{r}
colleges %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TUITIONFEE_IN, y = STABBR)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```



---
# Recall: The Pipe


* Idea:  The **data** is the primary object, so it should come first in your code.

--

* Idea:  Code should read **like a sentence**


---

# The Pipe

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('penguins %>% summary()', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("%>%") %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

is the same as

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('summary(penguins)', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair_funs(color = "teal")
```

---
# Readable code

What do you think the following will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---
# Readable code

What do you think the following will do?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```


---

# Summary

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summary()
  ') %>% flair("y(")
```

---
# Cleaning

Oh no!  There was one row of the dataset with missing values.

--

There is no magic answer for how to handle missing values; one solution is to simply drop them from the data.

*Consider - why might this sometimes be a bad idea?*

--

```{r}
penguins <- 
  penguins %>%
  drop_na()

penguins %>% 
  summary()
  
```


---
# Summarizing specifics

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g))
  ') %>% 
  flair("ize(") %>% 
  flair("mean", color = "teal") %>%
  flair("body_mass_g", color = "cornflowerblue")
```

--

* What are the **required** arguments of `summarize`?  

* Are there any optional arguments?

---

# Many variables?  Many summary statistics?
## No problemo


```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('penguins %>%
  summarize__at(vars(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm),
            list(avg_mean = mean, avg_med = median))',
  eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("_at") %>%
  flair("vars", background = "pink") %>%
  flair_rx("(mean)|(median)", color = "teal") %>%
  flair_rx("(body_mass_g)|(flipper_length_mm)", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  flair_rx("list", color = "darkred")
```

```{r summ_at, echo = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  summarize_at(vars(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm),
            list(avg_mean = mean, avg_med = median))
```

# Your Turn!

---
class: center, middle
# In `dplyr_activity.Rmd`, find the following:

* Mean, Median, and standard deviation of the in-state tuitions of colleges

* Total number of students (`UGDS`) in all colleges in this dataset.

---
# Making new variables

Verb: `mutate()`

The dataset gets *mutated* to include a new variable.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
  ) %>%
  summary()
  ') %>%
  flair("mutate") %>%
  flair("bill_size", color = "teal")
```

---

Cool, let's look at our new variable!

```{r, error = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
```

--

OH NO!

**What happened here?**

---

class: center, middle

# We calculated a new variable, but didn't reassign our dataset object

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('
penguins <- penguins %>%
          mutate(
            bill_size = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm
          )
          
penguins %>%
  summarize(mean_bill = sd(bill_size))
') %>% 
  flair("penguins <- ")


```

---
# Ordering

Verb: `arrange()`

We **arrange** the dataset in order of a particular variable.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---
# Ordering

Verb: `arrange()`

... or maybe we want it in **descending** (high to low) order.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  arrange(desc(body_mass_g))
```

---

## Related: `top_n`

```{r}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

---

# Quick check in!

Remember,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  top_n(3, body_mass_g)
```

is the same as

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(penguins, 3, body_mass_g)
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
top_n(x = penguins, n = 3, wt = body_mass_g)
```

---

# Selecting

Verb: `select()`

We **select** which variables we would like to remain in the dataset.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

---

# Filtering

Verb: `filter()`

We **filter** to the rows (observations) we would like to keep in the dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins_new %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  arrange(body_mass_g)
```

# Your Turn!

---

## In `dplyr_activity.Rmd`, make a new dataset called `colleges_limited`, with the following changes:

1. There is a new variable called `tuition_diff` which shows the difference between In-State and Out-of-State tuition for each college.

2. The dataset only includes this new variable, the name of the college, whether the college is private or public, and the state the college is in.

3. The dataset only includes California, Texas, and New York schools.

4. The institutions in the dataset are ordered from largest to smallest tuition difference.

**Try to do all these in one sequence of pipes!**

Bonus question: How much can we change the order of steps in the pipeline to get the same result?

# Grouping and summarizing
---
# `group_by`

* We have learned how to use the `summarize` functions to get information.

* What if you want to summarize your data within categories?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g))

```
---
# Warning!

## You should **always** have a `summarize` after a `group_by`!!!

--

(There are other ways to use it, but wait until you are very familiar with `dplyr` to try that.  Weird stuff happens.)

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Your Turn!

---
# Grouping and summarizing

* Find the average in-state tuition for public versus private schools.

* Find the average in-state tuition in NY, CA, and TX.

# Plotting: The pipe is your friend

Want a histogram of body mass for just *Adelie* species penguins?  Pipe it through `filter()` first!

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```

---

# Plotting: The pipe is your friend

Want to make a column plot showing the sizes of the penguins by species?  Pipe it through `group_by()` and `summarize()` first!

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height=4}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = avg_mass)) +
    geom_col()
```

---

# Plotting: The pipe is your friend

**Notice:** The new variable name `avg_mass`

```{r pipe_plot, include = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = avg_mass)) +
    geom_col()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('pipe_plot') %>%
  flair("avg_mass")
```

---

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Your Turn!

---
# Wrangling to Plot

Make the best plot you can to address the research question:

> Who has bigger in-state vs out-state difference: CA, Texas, or New York?

For bonus points, consider Public and Private school differences as well.
