# R History lesson:
# What is the `tidyverse`?

---
# The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages that follow a (somewhat) consistent philosophy and structure.

The term `base R` is sometimes used as an alternative, to refer to only R's built-in packages.

A brief history:

--

**2008:** `plyr` and `ggplot` released as part of **Hadley Wickham**'s doctoral dissertation.

--

**2012:** The pipe (`%>%`) is created.  

*(While the pipe itself is not technically tidyverse, the tidyverse is built around its use.)*

--

**2014:** `dplyr` released; Wickham hired as Chief Scientist at **RStudio**

--

**Today:** A paid team of 20-ish developers maintains a huge number of packages.  (https://www.tidyverse.org/)

---
# The tidyverse

* One philosophy of the **tidyverse** is building **pipe-friendly** functions.

* Another philosophy is using **English verbs** as function names instead of symbols or abbreviations.

* Some consider this more accessible/readable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie",]
```


---
# The tidyverse

**Pros:**

* Fairly consistent behavior of functions

    + Predictable **input** and **output** types
    + *"opinionated"*
    
--

* Semi-guaranteed maintenance of packages

(because RStudio pays developers!)

--

* More available and polished documentation and tutorials

--

* Welcoming community

---
# The tidyverse

**Cons:**

* Sometimes less flexible for complex tasks

--

* Generally slower, especially on big data

--

* Updates frequently -> sometimes this makes your old code unrunnable.

--

* Some people object to **RStudio**'s strong influence over an open-source community.

# Should you use the tidyverse???

--

Even the most die-hard tidyverse fanatics use base R and other packages quite frequently.

--

Above all, the best code approach is the one you enjoy the most and that gets the job done!
